        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
